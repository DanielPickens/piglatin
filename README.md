# piglatin
my js solution for the coderpad challenge:

Pig Latin is a farcical "language" used to entertain children, but also to teach them some valuable language concepts along the way.  Translating English to Pig Latin is simple:

1) Take the first consonant (or cluster of consonants) of a word, move it to the end of the word, and add a suffix of "ay"
2) If a word begins with a vowel, just add "way" at the end
3) For the sake of readability, separate the Pig Latin-ized parts of the word with a dash `-`

Your challenge is to implement the method `pigLatinize` that takes a string phrase and translates it to Pig Latin. You're free to add additional classes, variables, and methods if you would like.
